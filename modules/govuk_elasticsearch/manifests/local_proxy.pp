# == Class: govuk_elasticsearch::local_proxy
#
# Load balance connections to Elasticsearch by creating a loopback-only
# vhost in Nginx which will forward to a set of Elasticsearch servers.
#
# This is for the benefit of applications with client libraries that don't
# support native cluster awareness or load balancing.
#
# Using loopback rather than a separate load balancer node prevents network
# contention at a single point. Binding to loopback prevents the service
# from being exposed to clients on other nodes. And as a bonus, we get
# logging of all requests to ES.
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*port*]
#   Port to bind on loopback and of the remote Elasticsearch servers.
#   Default: 9200
#
# [*read_timeout*]
#   Nginx `proxy_read_timeout` value.
#   Default: 60
#
# [*servers*]
#   Array of servers to load balance requests to.
#
